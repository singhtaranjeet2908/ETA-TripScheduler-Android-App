# ETA-TripScheduler-Android-App

PROBLEM:
Friends schedule short trips all of the time. People go to lunch, dinner, a night out on the town, to the
movies, etc. The problem is, there is always that one person who is always late and makes everyone
wait. Personally, I never want to be the first person there and have to wait 30 minutes for the last
person to arrive.

SOLUTION:
ETA-TripScheduler, an app for you and your friends that predicts when you should leave your current location to arrive
at the same time as everyone else.

NOTE: This application has been designed and developed using Android's Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework.
